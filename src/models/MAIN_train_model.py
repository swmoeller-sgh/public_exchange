"""
Objective
==============
Generate the caption for an image using two NN (CNN and NLP).
https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-based-project-image-caption-generator-cnn/

1. Load the image and extract its features: Use a pre-trained deep learning model such as VGG or ResNet to extract the
features from the image and store the features in a variable.

2. Preprocess the captions: Tokenize the captions and convert them into numerical representations using a word
embedding.

3. Prepare the data: Split the data into training and testing sets, and create data loaders to feed the data into the
model during training and evaluation.

4. Define the LSTM model: Define the LSTM model architecture with PyTorch. The input to the LSTM should be the image
features and the output should be the predicted caption.

5. Train the model: Train the LSTM model using the training data and the PyTorch built-in loss functions and optimizers.

6. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data. You can use metrics such as BLEU or
ROUGE to evaluate the quality of the generated captions.

7. Generate captions: Use the trained LSTM model to generate captions for new images.

# 5. Tokenizing the vocabulary
# ----------------------------
"""
Computers don’t understand English words, for computers, we will have to represent them with numbers. So,
we will map each word of the vocabulary with a unique index value. Keras library provides us with the tokenizer
function that we will use to create tokens from our vocabulary and save them to a **“tokenizer.p”** pickle file.

An LSTM tokenizer is a type of deep learning model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to tokenize text.
Here is an outline of how you can create an LSTM tokenizer in Python:

1. Preprocess the text data: The first step is to preprocess the text data. This includes converting the text to
lowercase, removing punctuation, and splitting the text into sentences and tokens. You can use regular expressions
and other text preprocessing tools to achieve this.

2. Create a vocabulary: Create a vocabulary of the words in the text data. This vocabulary can be used to encode the
text data into numerical representations, which can be fed into the LSTM model. You can use a word embedding to map
words to vectors and use a one-hot encoding to map words to numbers.

3. Define the LSTM model architecture: Define the architecture of the LSTM model. This involves specifying the number
of LSTM units, the number of layers, the activation function, and the input and output shapes.

4. Train the LSTM model: Train the LSTM model on the preprocessed text data. You can use a categorical cross-entropy
loss function and an optimizer such as Adam to train the model. You should also set aside a portion of the data for
validation to monitor the model's performance during training.

5. Tokenize the text data: Once the model is trained, you can use it to tokenize new text data. You can feed the
text data into the trained LSTM model and use the output to generate the tokenized text.

6. Save and load the model: Finally, save the trained LSTM model so that you can use it later without having to
train it again. You can use the Keras or TensorFlow libraries in Python to save and load the model.
